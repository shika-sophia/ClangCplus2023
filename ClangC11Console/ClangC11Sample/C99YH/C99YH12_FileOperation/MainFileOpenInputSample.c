*         EChange comment-out of 'main()' to active.
*         EChange comment-out of 'consoleInput()' definition to active.
*         EChange comment-out of 'fopen()' to active and 'fopen_s()' to negative.
*         EExecute by [Windows Command Prompt for VS2019]
*           (because, C11-compiled by Visual Studio, it throws Compile Error by cause of 'fopen() unsafe'.)
*         EIt asks file name ,and then Paste the file name and [Enter] Key.
*         E(Return back whole of changes for another Compile, after execution here.)
