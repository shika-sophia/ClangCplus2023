*         ECopy the file name as relative path [ ..\\C99YH07_WhileIteration\\lorem.txt ].
*         EChange comment-out of 'main()' to active.
*         EChange comment-out of 'consoleInput()' definition to active.
*         EChange comment-out of 'fopen()' to active and 'fopen_s()' to negative.
*         EExecute by [Windows Command Prompt for VS2019]
*           (because, C11-compiled by Visual Studio, it throws Compile Error by cause of 'fopen() unsafe'.)
*         EIt asks file name ,and then Paste the file name and [Enter] Key.
*         E(Return back whole of changes for another Compile, after execution here.)
* 
*         [Example]
*         Please input File Name > ..\\C99YH07_WhileIteration\\lorem.txt

*@subject ŸThe reason why variable 'c' is defined as 'int', not 'char'.
*         EBecause it can recognize 'EOF' exactly, whose value is -1.
*         EIf 'c' is defined as 'char', and if '\xFF' character is in the document,
*           most significant digit of bit does sign-expand, changes to -1,
*           and it is recognized as 'EOF' unexactly, the document is cut off where is not end of file.
*         => see kC99YH p199l
*         => copy from kC99YH07_WhileIteration\MainWhileEOF_withFileLoad.cl
*
*@subject ŸLine Feed Character (Depending on Text Editor Settings)
*         Ewhen read, '\n' -> divide CR [Carriage Return], LF [Line Feed] -> '\x0D', '\x0A'
*         Ewhen write, '\x0D', '\x0A' -> CR, LF -> '\n'
*         E'\x1A' [Ctrl + Z] is recognized as 'EOF' [End of File]
*
*@subject ŸNULL Pointer kC99YH p364l
*         <stdio.h> => INDEXkC99YH12_FileOperation/MainFileOpenInputSample.cl
*            „¤ #define NULL 0
*
*         E'NULL': A symbol meaning "nothing of reference".
*         ENULL Pointer: Pointer can be assigned '0'.  0 means NULL.
*         ENULL Pointer is used to express end of link, when Liner List or Tree Data Structure.
*         EYou can assign NULL to any Pointer.
*         EYou cannot assign any value to NULL Pointer
*         EYou cannot refer to value of NULL Pointer.
*         ENULL Check: Before operate 'p', it is necessary to check if p is NULL or not.
*
*         [Example]
*         int *p;
*         p = NULL;
*
*         [~] *p = 123;  -> Compile Error: NULL pointer assignment,
*                          -> or output unexpected value, or do unexpeted behavior,
*                          -> or enforcely exited by OS.
*
*         [~] printf("%p \n", p);  // when 'p = NULL'
*
*         [Example] NULL Check
*         if (p != NULL) {
*             // write operation: assginment or reference, about 'p' here.
*         }
*
*         => copy fromkC99YH11_Pointer\MainPointerBasic.cl
*
*@subject ŸVoid Cast
*         If program need not check NULL or else Errors, in sense of telling it obviously,
*         you can explicitly add '(void)' before the function calling, as meaning to ignore the return-value.
*
*         [Example]
*         (void)func(x, y);
* 
*@subject ŸFile Open
*         Open:  The operation that Function 'fopen()' asks OS of user environment, "From now, I will open the file, Can I ?".
*         Close: The operation that Function 'fclose()' tells OS of user environment, "I will not use the file any more."
*
*         FILE* fopen(const char* _FileName, const char* _Mode)
*         [Argument] 
*         const char* _FileName: string text of file name to operate
*         const char* _Mode:     string text of file open purpose
*         [Return]
*         FILE*: File Pointer Type
*           If it success to open the file, value of FILE* is corresponding with address (= location) in the opened file contents, as one by one.
*           If it failure to open the file, value of FILE* is assigned 'NULL' (means no reference), which is called "NULL Pointer",
*           in this case, program need check NULL, nevertheless it behave unexpectedly or exit unusually.
*           
*         ŸFile Open Mode 
*         "r":  Text File to read
*         "w":  Text File to write (file length is 0.)
*         "a":  Text File to append writing
*         "rb": Binary File to read
*         "wb": Binary File to write (file length is 0.)
*         "ab": Binary File to append writing
*         "r+": Text File to read and write
*         "w+": Text File to read and write (file length is 0.)
*         "a+": Text File to read and append writing
*         "r+b" or "rb+": Binary File to read and write
*         "w+b" or "wb+": Binary File to read and write (file length is 0.)
*         "a+b" or "ab+": Binary File to read and append writing
* 
*         –NOTE
*         Text File:   Human can read and write its contents, can operate with Text-Editor,
*                      and define with extension [.txt].
*         Binary File: Machine Language described only '0' and '1', usally cannot be understand by human.
*                      It cannot read and write usual Text-Editor, but can do by Binary-Editor. 
*                      For example, Execute File of Windows [.exe], Object File yielded by C language Compile [.obj],
*                      Image File [.jpg][.gif][.png], Music File [.mp3][.wav], Movie File [.mp4][.mpeg] etc...
*         Read:  Program <- File
*         Write: Program -> File
*
*@subject ŸFile Close
*         EDon't forget file close, 
*           because FOPEN_MAX the maximum number which OS of user environment can open files at same time, is limited 20 (defined in <stdio.h>). 
*         E(Depending on OS), when you open file, expect to write something there, and remain to open (= do not close),
*           if you reset PC, the file record could be deleted, though you have already written it, but un-saved because of 'not close'.
*           
*         int  fclose(FILE* _Stream)
*         [Argument]  FILE* -Stream:  File Pointer which have already opened.
*         [Return]    int (as bool)
*            0:      correctly
*            EOF -1: uncorrectly
* 
*            [Example] If Conditional Expression were not 0, True. 
*            [~] if (fclose(fileP) != 0) { ... }   //The if-statement means "if fclose() returns true, condition is true".
*                 ||                               //Therefore you can write more simplely: 'if (fclose())'.
*                 ||                               //ŸShould not compare both boolean values
*                 ||                               // => see if-statmentkC99YH04_ConditionalBranch\MainValidateInputSample.cl
*            [Z] if (fclose(fileP)) { ... }
*
*@subject ŸGet char kC99YH p391l
*         Efgetc() get 'char' one by one Byte, from Pointer of the file which has already opend by 'fopen()' with Mode "r" or "rb".
*         EThe operation is continued to read by 'while'-statement, so that whole of file contents can read.
* 
*         <stdio.h>
*         int  fgetc(FILE* fileP)

*         [Return]   int c          // defined as 'int', not as 'char', because EOF can be recieved too.
*                      n:      If success to read 'char', it returns the ASCII code (= character code).
*                      EOF -1: End of File, or Error while File Read  -> ferror()
*
*@subject ŸPut char kC99YH p394l
