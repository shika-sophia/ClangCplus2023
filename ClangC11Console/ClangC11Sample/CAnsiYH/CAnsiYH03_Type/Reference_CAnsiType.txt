          Type: ・Data kinds of Variable value
                ・Compiler decide how to operate the value by Type.
                ・When calculate different Types, Compiler do Type-Change implicitly (= automatically) in necessary.
                ・How Bytes or Bits each Types have in Memory, depend on Comiler,
                  They are moderately specified by C. more strictly by C++.

          [Kinds of Types]
          ・Primitive Type: Types default-defined by specification of C language; such as char, int, float, double, and void.
          ・Derived Type:   Types self-defined by programmer; such as Array, Function, Pointer, Struct, Union.

*@subject <limits.h> 〔CAnsi p39, p272〕〔C99YH 10 | p49, p206〕
          ・This is a Standard Header File default-defined by specification of C language.
          ・It define the maximum and minimum constant value of Primitive Types.
          ・Because they depend on Compiler, they are sometimes different.
          ★By using these constant values defined in it, a program is to be more transplantable.

          【Annotation】in this Compiler case:  (Compiler is clang-C11 of Visual Studio 2019)
           It is no difference between 'int' and 'long'. (= the same range)

          => see another Headers and more detail.〔ReferenceDocument\Reference_NumericTypeRange.txt〕

*@subject ◆Type name
          The opportunity of using Type name:
          ・When you declarate a Global Varianle.
          ・When you define a Local Variable.
          ・When you expilcitly change Type by using Operator Cast expressed as '(Type)'.
          ・When you use Operator 'sizeof(Type)', as its Argument.

*@subject ◆Primitive Types: default-defined by specification of C language
          ・Whole of Types in C is based on this and yielded from this.

          ＊char:   Character
          ＊int:    Integer
          ＊float:  Single-Precision Floating-Point Number
          ＊double: Double-Precision Floating-Point Number
          ＊void:   Type expressing empty.

*@subject ◆Derived Types: self-defined by programmer
          ＊Array
          (＊Function) => more detail 〔CAnsiYH Chapter10〕
          ＊Pointer
          ＊Struct
          ＊Union
          
*@advance ◎Recursive Definition 〔p41〕
          [Math] recursion (n):  To iterate as same structure as itself.
                                 -> recurse (v), recursive (adj)

          Derived Types is available recursively.
          It is able to create many numbers of new Types, by recursively defining of Deriverd Type.

          [Example]
          T-Type:                    Asumming there were T-Type, T-Type is a new Type.
          Array of T-Type:           If you define as a array 'T[]', it is created as a new Type more.
          Array of Array of T-Type:  As same, this is created as a new Type too, it is called "2-Dimension Array" T[][].
            :
          (countless)

*@subject ◆Integer Types 〔p41〕
          ・The specification of Compiler adjust each Types range to easily use for the device.
          ・Depending on Compiler, short or long sometimes don't have the range as below.

          [Kinds of Integer Types]
          ・char:              8 bit = 2 ^  8 = 256
          ・short [int]:      16 bit = 2 ^ 16 = 65536
          ・int:              32 bit = 2 ^ 32 = 4294967296
          ・long [int]:   
          ・long long [int]:  64 bit = 2 ^ 64 = 18446744073709551617
          ※ [int] can be omitted.

          + signed:    The keyword is used by adding before Type above,
                       to tell Compiler that the Type have signs, such as '+' or '-'.
                       It is omittable, in that case (= no keyword), it means 'signed'.
          + unsigned:  The keyword is used by adding before Type above,
                       to tell Compiler that the Type have no signs, and plus value only.

          => see Range of Integer Types〔ReferenceDocument\Reference_NumericTypeRange.txt〕

*@subject ◆Character Types 'char' 〔p42〕
          ・'char' storages one character code value as numeric value, expressed with single quote [ ' ' ].
          ・char '0' is different from int 0. / '0' value is 48 as if ASCII.
          ・char 'a' is different from "a". / 'a' is char constant value. / "a" is String text.
          
          ・String text is defined as Array of 'char' Type. 
            While [Java][C#] have String Type, but [C][C++] don't have it.
          ・'char' Type is a sort of Integer Types, because the value is storaged as numeric value in Memory.
            Therefore 'char' can be calculated as like Integer.
          ・'char' can be added keywords 'signed' or 'unsigned' before Type.
          
          ・In case of input excepting chatacter, which the value is minus or not, depend on Compiler.
          ・In case of wide-character, as same.
          ・In case of comparing values high or low, it is important difference with 'signed' or 'unsigned'.
          ★Programmer should describe 'signed' or 'unsigned' explicitly.
          
*@advance ◎well-known Failure
          ・In case of using Function 'getchar()', The value should be storaged in 'int' Type, not 'char';
            because conatant value of 'EOF' which express end of file, is defined as -1,
            it is important to ensurely operate 'EOF' gotton by 'getchar()'.
          ・That is well-known Failure for programmer.
     
          [Example]
          int c;   // <- Here, not 'char'.

          while ((c == getchar()) != EOF) {
              putchar(c);
          }

*@subject ◆String text 〔p44〕
          ・String text is defined as Array of 'char' Type. 
            While [Java][C#] have String Type, but [C][C++] don't have it.
          ・It is expressed with double quote [ " " ].

          [Example]
          ＊These are the same meaning.
          char  strAry[] = "ABC";                 // In this case, '\0' NULL Character is automatically inserted by Compiler.
          char  strAry[] = {'A', 'B', 'C', '\0'}; // using Initializer '{ }' 

          ＊These are the same behavior, which shows "ABC".
          printf("%s\n", "ABC");
          printf("%s\n", strAry);
          printf("%s\n", &strAry[0]);    // [ & ] is Address Operetor of Pointer〔below〕

*@subject ◆Enum Type 〔p45〕
          enum: The keyword of 'enum' Type, which enumerate constant Identifer (= called "Enumerator"), 
                corresponding with the int value, and delimitted by [ , ].
                It is used at declaration of 'enum' Type.
                (In Pascal which is a prorgram language, the Partial Range Type is similar with this, because it is self-defined as a subset of Integer Types.
                 But it of Pascal is defined with setting of ranges between maximum and minimum, it is different from 'enum' of C)

          [Format] Declaration
          enum tag_name { enumerator1, enumerator2, enumerator3 ... };

          typedef enum tag_name  { 
              enumerator1, enumerator2, enumerator3, ... 
          } alias;

          ・tag_name:  It is Identifier of 'enum' name, and it is omitable.

          ・enumerator1, enumerator2 ... :
              The Enumerator name need be unique, and need be diffenent from any Identifiers in the same scope.
              The sequece of Enumerator or 'enumerator = constant expression', is delimitted by [ , ].
              By declaration, each Enumerator automatially have int value, such as 0, 1, 2 ... .
              Or these enum 'int' values can be self-defined by describing 'enumerator = constant expression'. => see〔＊self-assign the value〕

          ・alias:  Operator 'typedef' can define alias name to Type.

          [Format] Definition and Assignment of enum value 
          enum tag_name Variable_name = enum_value;

          [Example]
          -- Declaration and Definition --
          enum EnumColorRGB {
              RED, GREEN, BLUE
          };

          enum EnumColorRGB colorR = RED; 
          enum EnumColorRGB colorG = GREEN; 
          enum EnumColorRGB colorB = BLUE;
          
          -- Declaration and Definition at the same time --
          enum EnumColorRGB { RED, GREEN, BLUE } colorR = RED;

          -- Declaration and Definition using 'typedef' --
          typedef enum EnumColorRGB {
              RED, GREEN, BLUE
          } Color;

          Color colorR = RED;

*@subject ＊'#define' instead of 'enum' definition
          #define: One of Directive for Pre-processor, expressed by '#'.
                   It define constant Identifier with the constant value.
                   =>〔CAnsiYH01_Introduction\Reference_CAnsiIntrodiction.txt〕

          ・To use '#define' instead of 'enum' definiition:
            It is almost similar as orthodox 'enum' definition, but see below.

          [Example]
          #define RED 0
          #define GREEN 1
          #define BLUE 2
          ----
          int colorR = RED;

         ・The "almost" means that: 
         Using '#define', it define the Token as Identifier only.
         Pre-processor operation will replace the Token to calling a Function which return the constant value.
         Before Compiler will parse and grammatically validate by C language, the replacement will have been done;
         so that Compiler cannot find out grammatical errors in the source code, and
         so that Symbolic-Debuger cannot refer the Symbol name.
   
         ★[Conclusion] 
         Programmers had better use orthodox 'enum' definition than '#define' way.

*@subject ＊'const' instead of 'enum' definition
          const: The keyword which define consatant Identifier with the constant value,
                 and after definition, It prevent to be assigned some values by user. 

         ・It is almost similar as orthodox 'enum' definition.
           But not using 'enum' definition, it is weaken with Programmer's intention that
           these Identifiers are concerned each other, one value of the same symbol.

         [Example]
         const int RED = 0;
         const int GREEN = 1;
         const int BLUE = 2;

*@subject ＊self-defined the int values of enumerators
          ・The enum 'int' values can be self-defined by describing 'enumerator = constant expression'.
          ・They are omitable, in this case, automatically assigned such as [ 0, 1, 2, ... ].
          ・They can be assigned the same value with different Enumerators, 
            so that you can express that different Enumerators do the same behavior, as Alias,
            but so that it maybe not appropriate with 'enum' intention.

          [Format]
          enum tag_name { 
              enumerator1 = constant_expression1,
              enumerator2 = constant_expression2,
              enumerator3 = constant_expression3,
                :
          };

          [Example]
          enum ErrorCode {
              MEMBER_ERROE = 10,
              CALC_ERROR = 11,
              UNKOWN = 12,
          };

          ・If the values are incremental by +1, you can describe the first value only, as same meaning.
          [Example]
          enum ErrorCode {
              MEMBER_ERROE = 10,
              CALC_ERROR,
              UNKOWN,
          };

*@subject ◆Floating-Point Number Types〔p47〕
          ・Floating-Point Number: The Number of not only fractional such as 3.14159, -2.236e5; also exponential such as 2 ^ 8, 10e+24,
                                   is used in case of Mathematical calculation, Statistical data, and some simulations.
          
          ・Which Types we should use, in these cases:
            ・float:       When we do not warry about strictness or precision of the calculation.
            ・double:      When we use Mathematics Function in C, or usually calculate Floating-Point Numbers.
            ・long double: When we are interested in strictness or precision of the calculation.

          ★【Annotation】caluclation of Floating-Point Number
          ・It is possible to happen Lack of Binary Digit,
            by calculating Floating-Point Numbers or changing the Types.
          ・Don't use the Types in case to be neccesary nothing of subtle difference, 
            such as caluculation of money deposit.

          [Lack of Binary Digit]: 
          Each Types has some Bytes as the space in Memory, depending on Compiler,
          such as 'int' 32 bit (= 4 Bytes), 'long' 64 bit (= 8 Bytes) , 'float' 32 bit, 'double' 64 bit.
          When we assign Variable to value or do Cast Type-Change explicitly,
          in the case from narrow to wide range of Type, it is no problem.
          but in the opposite case from wide to narrow, it is happen to be shortage of Binary Digit.
          
          There are some kinds of the cause:
          ・Overflow or Underflow of Binary Digit by caluclation or assignment
          ・lack imformation of extreamly small value
          ・suspending culculate of eternal faction number

*@subject ◆Void Type 〔p48〕
          ・void: The Type of expessing nothing, which have no value and cannot caluculate.
           (In Pascal, it is called "Procedure". In Basic, "Sub-routine".)

          ・Variable of 'void' Type cannot be defined.
          ・But Pointer which indicate 'void' Type, can be defined. 〔for [Example]〕
          
          ・When Return Type of Function is defined as 'void' Type,
            statement 'return xxxx;' cannot be used with expression or value, because 'void' means no return-value.
            statement 'return;' can be done only without expression or value, to return Control of Program;

          ・It is used in these cases:
            ・When we express Argument Type of Function as nothing, 'void' means no argument.
            ・When we express Return Type of Function as nothing, 'void' means no return-value.
            ・When we define General Pointer. => 〔for [Example]〕

           [Example]
           int main(void) {  }
           void showValue (int a, int b) { }

           [Example] General Pointer case =>〔CAnsiYH Chapter 6, p118〕
           void *alloc_money (size_t n) {
               void *p;   // <- Here, Program get to own the space in Memory, as Pointer 'p'.

               return p;
           }

*@subject ◆Pointer Type 〔p49〕=> more detail〔CAnsiYH Chapter 6〕
          [Definition]
          ・Pointer: The Type which indicate address of some Type value or the value.
          ・address: The location in Memory, expressed by 'int' value.
           (In Assembler, it corresponds to "Indirect-Reference".)

          [Operator of Pointer]
          ・Address Operator  [ & ]:  It means the adderss of Variable, expressed such as '&x'.
          ・Indirect Operator [ * ]:  It means Indirect-Refernence value of Variable which Pointer indicate, 
                                      expressed such as '*p'.
          ・Assign Operator [ = ]:    When Pointer is assigned Address of some Variable, it is expressed such as 'p = &x;'
          ・Arithmetic Operator [ + - ++ -- ]: 
               To add or subtract value of Pointer, mean to navigate address of Variable value which Pointer indicate.
               so that we can regard Memory as Array of Object (= Variable) by using Pointer.
               Actually, These are the same meaning, incresing value of Pointer and specifing index of Pointer Array
               expressed such as *(p + m) and p[m] (assuming p: Pointer, m: int value).

               => more detial〔Relation of Array and Pointer | CAnsiYH p111〕

          ・Compare Operator [ == < > ... ]: Pointer can be compared by using them.

*@subject ◆Array Type 〔p50〕=> more detial〔CAnsiYH Chapter 5〕
          ・Array: The Type which have sequence of specific Type values.
          ・We can define Array of any Type which we want, in C.
          ・Array size need be constant, when Compile.
          ・Array dimensions can be defined arbitrarily.
          ・Array of Function cannot be defined.
            Instead of that, Array of Function Pointer can be defined.

            [Dispatch Table]:
            One of data structure which dispatch (= allocate) Function by functional index.
            in this case, Array of Function Pointer often is defined.
            => see 〔Array of Function Pointer| CAnsiYH p115〕

*@subject ◆Struct => more detail 〔CAnsiYH Chapter 7〕
          struct: The Type which include different multi Types, to put them together.
                  It is one of Derived Types.

*@subject ◆Union  => more detail 〔CAnsiYH Chapter 7〕
          union:  The Type to be shared one Memory-space by different multi Types.
                  It is one of Derived Types, too.

*@subject ◆Predefined-Keyword 'typedef' 〔p52〕
          typedef: The Keyword to create arbitrary Type we want, to name arbitrary Alias.
          ・We can name Alias to Types of default-defined or self-defined.
          ・The Alias is called "typedef Name". 
          ・The Alias defined by 'typedef', is recognized as same as default Types, by Compiler.
            => see 〔Differences of '#define' and 'typedef' | CAnsiYH p254〕

          ・[Predefined-Keyword of Storage Class] =>〔CAnsiYH p75 | CAnsiYH04_Variable\Reference_CAnsiVariable.txt〕
            There are 'static', 'extern', 'auto', 'register'. 
            The 'typedef' is one of this sorts, too.

          ★The 'typedef' is often used, to write transplantable code: 〔as below [Example]〕
            such as 'BOOL' or 'ID' defiened by 'typedef' to make them obviously meaning, instead of multi 'int' or 'long Variables;
            such as 'MATE' instead of 'struct SchoolMate' to be able to shorten the description as same meaning;
            such as when Pointer 'void*' cannot be used because of older Compiler, and you will try to transplant Pointer there,
            you write 'typedef char *PIOINTER;', so that it can be easy to modify the transplant.

          [Format]

          typedef long ID;
          typedef void *POINTER;
          typedef short WORD, wordtype;  // Type 'WORD' and Variable 'wordtype' are defined as short-Type.
          typedef BOOL YESNO;            // Alias can be defined as another Alias again.

          typedef struct SchoolMate { 
            ...
          } MATE;

          [Example] Definition or Declaration can be done after above.
          ＊Variable Definition
          BOOL isMember;                 // The Type is int as boolean.

          ＊struct Definition
          MATE member1 = { ... };        // instead of "struct SchoolMate member1 = { ... };"

          ＊Function Declaration
          POINTER alloc_memory(size_t);  // The Return Value is void*.
