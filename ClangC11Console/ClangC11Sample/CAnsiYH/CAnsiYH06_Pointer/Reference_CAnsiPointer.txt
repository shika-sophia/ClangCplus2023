          [Definition]
          EPointer: The Type which indicate address of some Type value or the value.
          Eaddress: The location in Memory, expressed by 'int' value.
           (In Assembler, it corresponds to "Indirect-Reference".)

          [Operator of Pointer]
          EAddress Operator  [ & ]:  It means the adderss of Variable, expressed such as '&x'.
          EIndirect Operator [ * ]:  It means Indirect-Refernence value of Variable which Pointer indicate, 
                                      expressed such as '*p'.
          EAssign Operator [ = ]:    When Pointer is assigned Address of some Variable, it is expressed such as 'p = &x;'
          EArithmetic Operator [ + - ++ -- ]: 
               To add or subtract value of Pointer, mean to navigate address of Variable value which Pointer indicate.
               so that we can regard Memory as Array of Object (= Variable) by using Pointer.
               Actually, These are the same meaning, incresing value of Pointer and specifing index of Pointer Array
               expressed such as *(p + m) and p[m] (assuming p: Pointer, m: int value).

               => more detialkRelation of Array and Pointer | CAnsiYH p111l

          ECompare Operator [ == < > ... ]: Pointer can be compared by using them.

*@subject ¡ Pointer kp107l
          Pointer: EA Type which indicate address of a Variable, Function, or Object such as Array.
                   EPointer is one of Derived Types which can be self-defined by Programmer. 
                     => Derived Types kCAnsiYH03_Type\Reference_CAnsiType.txtl
                   EAssuming that there is a Type 'T', the Pointer to T is expressed as Type 'T*',
                     which is called "Pointer to T Type" or "Pointer which indicate T Type".
                   EWe can indirectly refer and assign to some Variables by using a Pointer. => Indirect-Referencekbelowl

          Indirect-Reference: 
                   When a Pointer indicate a Variable 'int i',
                   we can refer to the value of 'i' and assign some value to 'i', by using the Pointer.
                   => [Example] in "ŸIndirect-Reference and Assignment by Pointer". kmore belowl

          Pointer Variable: Variable of Type T*
          Pointer value:    value of Type T*
          It is often complicated that "Pointer Variable" or "Pointer value" are simply called "Pointer".

          [Example]
          int i;    // Definition Variable of 'int' Type
          int *ip;  // Definition Pointer which indicate address of 'int' Type.

          ip = &i;  // Pointer 'ip' is assigned address of Variable 'int i', expressed by Adderss Operator [ & ].
                    // Then the Pointer storage address in Memory of it.
                    // In the other words, Conditional Expression 'ip == &i' is true.
                    // When a Pointer 'ip' indicate a Variable 'int i',
                    // we can refer to the value of 'i' and assign some value to 'i', by using the Pointer 'ip'.

          int *ip = &i; // We can write that, as Definition and Intialization Pointer at the same time.
                        // Though Indirect Operator [ * ] express the value of Variable which Pointer indicate,
                        // the expression 'int *ip = &i;' means both of Definition Pointer 'int *ip;' and Intialization 'ip = &i;'. 

*@subject ŸDefinition of Pointer kp108l
          [Example]
          –Pointer to Variable
          int  *ip;                 // Definition Pointer 'ip' which indicate 'int' Type.
          char *cp;                 // Definition Pointer 'cp' which indicate 'char' Type.
          struct SchoolMate *mateP; // Definition Pointer 'mateP' which indicate 'struct SchoolMate'.
          T    *tp                  // Generally, Definition Pointer 'tp' which indicate 'T' Type.

          –Pointer to Function
          int (*fp)(char);          // Definition Pointer 'fp' which indicate Function whose Argument is one 'char' Type and whose Return-Type is 'int' Type.

*@subject ŸAddress Operator [ & ]kp108l
          Address Operator [ & ]: 
            EOperator which add '&' before Variable to express address of the Variable.
              Strictly, the Variable which can be put as 'Left Side Value'.
              => Left Side Value kCAnsiYH p74lkCAnsiYH04_Variable\Reference_CAnsiVariable.txtl
            
            EPointer is intialized or assigned address of Variable with '&', as [Examble] above.
              
            EThough the symbol '&' is as same as Bit Arithemetic Operator [ & ] or Logical Operator [ && ],
              of course, it is different meaning from these.

*@subject ŸIndirect-Reference and Assignment by Pointer kp109l
          Indirect-Reference: kabovel

          [Example] 
          int i;
          int *ip = &i;

          *ip = 10;     // The assignment change value of Variable 'i' to 10 and Pointer value '*ip' to 10,
                        // but Pointer 'ip' is no change, still.
                        // Therefore, Don't confuse or identify Pointer value '*ip' and Pointer Variable 'ip',
                        // which are different.
